# Backported Gamerules

Yup. Backporting 1.20 gamerules to the older versions(probably only 1.18-1.19)

## Progress:
- [x] blockExplosionDropDecay // Bed, Respawn Anchor, End Crystal
- [x] mobExplosionDropDecay // Creeper, Fireball, Wither, Wither skull
- [x] tntExplosionDropDecay // TNT, TNT minecart
- [x] snowAccumulationHeight (snowLayersKillGrass was added for cosmetic purposes)
- [x] waterSourceConversion
- [x] lavaSourceConversion
- [ ] globalSoundEvents // **true** - works as intended, **false** - completely disables global sound events, need to fix
